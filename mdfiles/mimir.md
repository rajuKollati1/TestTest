## What is Mimir?

**Mimir** is like a **super smart notebook** that remembers lots of numbers (metrics) from your computers, apps, or Kubernetes pods.

You know how **Prometheus** collects metrics like:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- How many times something happened?

Well, **Mimir** is the **big brain** that helps **store that data for a long time** and **answer questions fast**.

## 📦 What Are Mimir Distributed Pods?

Mimir is split into many **small helpers (pods)**, and each pod has **one special job**.

Let’s meet the team! 🧑‍🍳👷‍♀️🧑‍🏫👩‍💻

---

### 👨‍🏫 `alertmanager`

> 📢 "If something goes wrong, I tell you!"

- Watches for problems (like high CPU).
- Sends messages (email, Slack, etc.).
- Helps you take action fast.

---

### 🗃️ `chunks-cache`

> "I remember pieces of old data so others don’t ask again and again."

- Keeps small **pieces of metric data** ready.
- Makes things **faster** for repeat queries.

---

### 🧹 `compactor`

> "I clean and organize your messy storage!"

- Merges small files into big ones.
- Cleans up old or duplicate data.
- Keeps storage nice and tidy.

---

### 🧠 `index-cache`

> "I remember where things are, so we find them quickly."

- Keeps a **shortcut map** of labels and series.
- Helps when you ask things like: `job="app"`.

---

### 📝 `metadata-cache`

> "I remember what things are called and what they do."

- Remembers **names and types** of metrics.
- Helps Grafana show suggestions and autocomplete.

---

### 🔍 `querier`

> "You ask me questions, I go find the answers!"

- Answers PromQL queries from Grafana or you.
- Talks to ingesters, caches, or store-gateway to fetch data.

---

### 📦 `results-cache`

> "If you asked this before, I give you the answer super fast."

- Remembers **old query results**.
- Speeds up dashboards and repeated queries.

---

### 🧰 `store-gateway`

> "I go fetch old data from the big storage room."

- Reads data from long-term storage (like S3).
- Helps when you query **historical metrics**.

---

## 🎯 Example: "What Was CPU Usage Last Week?"

1. **Grafana** sends the question to 👉 **Querier**
2. Querier asks **Store Gateway** to fetch old data
3. **Store Gateway** pulls from object storage
4. Querier uses **Index/Chunk/Result caches** to speed things up
5. Final answer is sent to Grafana 📊
